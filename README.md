# Multi_Branch_Fusion_Auto_Encoder
Upgrading a basic vanilla auto encoder  to  better architecture...
So when i was building a simple auto-encoder in which you have a encoder part , latent space and decoder...And as we know that the main-objective of the encoder is to create efficient and reliable latent space(Bottleneck - which contains the relevant information about  our input data(For ex: Image) So that our decoder can reconstruct the orignal data from our latent space...
So i thought rather then having a one encoder-decoder lets try branched encoder-decoder what i mean there will be one encoder we fill pass that encoder output to two parralel sub encoders which try to explore more of the encoders latent space and then we will fuse both of there ouputs in a single latent space in our code the root encoder was 10 densor vector wide and both of the sub encoder sre of 10 dim so there will fuse will be 20 dim dense vector and this dense vector will be a better representation of our original data compared to simple encoder-decoder and then we passed this vector to our root decoder that makes original data but we will pass this vector to our 2 parallel sub decoders which try new possiblity of reconstructions and then fuse there outputs to one dense vector and then we pass this vector to our last global decoder which will create the original data...
So rather then having only one encoder-decoder we are upgrading this architecture to a multi branch fusion encoder-decoder
